Red Bull's driver lineup decisions have sparked intrigue and debate in the Formula 1 world. Liam Lawson currently holds the seat in the Red Bull RB21, while Yuki Tsunoda races for Racing Bulls. This choice has left many, including former Aston Martin strategist and Sky F1 analyst Bernie Collins, wondering if it will remain unchanged throughout the season.

Last year, Red Bull chose to promote Lawson over Tsunoda after deciding to part ways with Sergio Perez. Despite Tsunoda outperforming Daniel Ricciardo and Lawson in their races together, Red Bull saw greater potential in Lawson. However, the season opener in Australia saw Tsunoda outperforming Lawson, qualifying fifth despite a strategic error from the team that left him outside the points. Lawson, on the other hand, faced challenges, failing to advance past Q1 and crashing out of the race.

Collins questions Red Bull's decision, noting Tsunoda's improvement in composure and performance. She acknowledges that while fans see the on-track results, the internal dynamics and contributions during engineering debriefs remain unseen. Tsunoda himself expressed frustration over the decision, admitting he doesn't fully understand why he was passed over, especially after proving himself against Ricciardo.

Tsunoda is now focused on his future, aiming to become a more complete driver. Collins advises that maintaining strong performances will be key for him, particularly if he continues to out-qualify his Red Bull counterpart. This ongoing saga promises to keep fans and analysts alike watching closely as the season progresses.

In the world of Formula 1, rivalries are as thrilling off the track as they are on it. The tension between McLaren's CEO Zak Brown and Red Bull Racing's principal Christian Horner has been simmering for years, but recent developments have brought it back into the spotlight. For fans in Australia and New Zealand, this is a storyline that adds another layer of excitement to the sport we love.

Zak Brown has never been one to shy away from expressing his views, and his recent comments have reignited the feud with Christian Horner. The friction largely stems from McLaren's criticism of Red Bull's handling of F1's cost cap regulations, especially after Red Bull exceeded the cap in 2021. Brown has been vocal about the need for stricter enforcement, while Horner has defended his team, dismissing the criticisms.

This rivalry is not just about team politics; it feels personal. The ongoing exchanges between these two influential figures highlight the competitive nature of Formula 1. While McLaren is striving to close the gap on Red Bull's dominance, the off-track drama adds an intriguing subplot to the season.

As the 2024 season unfolds, the Brown-Horner rivalry will undoubtedly continue to capture attention. While McLaren might not yet be challenging Red Bull for wins, Brown's leadership is pushing the team to aim higher. Meanwhile, Horner's sharp responses ensure that the back-and-forth will persist.

For F1 fans, this is part of what makes the sport so captivating. The battles aren't just fought on the track; they're waged in the boardrooms and media as well. Whether this rivalry will ever be resolved is uncertain, but for now, it's clear that there's certainly no love lost between these two.

The Australian Grand Prix weekend provided a revealing glimpse into Red Bull Racing's current performance with the RB21 at Albert Park. Despite being described by Christian Horner as 'much calmer' than its predecessor, the RB21 still struggles to match the speed of competitors like McLaren. The challenge lies in finding the right setup to optimize the car's performance.

During testing in Bahrain, Red Bull introduced significant changes to the car, including a new front wing and floor. At the Australian GP, Max Verstappen and Liam Lawson tested different configurations. Verstappen used the new front wing and floor, while Lawson had the base configuration with the new floor. These adjustments aimed to improve aerodynamic efficiency, but the team faced difficulties in achieving the desired balance between mechanical grip and aerodynamic stability.

Friday's practice sessions were challenging, with the RB21 displaying instability. Engineers worked tirelessly to address these issues, and by Saturday, improvements were evident. Verstappen's strong qualifying performance highlighted the car's potential once the setup was optimized.

However, the race revealed ongoing challenges with tire overheating, particularly on intermediates. Verstappen managed to maintain competitiveness initially but struggled as the race progressed. He cited overheating as a key issue, underscoring the need for continued development.

Red Bull's technical struggles persist, with the RB21 requiring precise setup adjustments to unlock its potential. The upcoming Sprint weekend in China presents a further test, with limited time to refine the car's setup.

As the season progresses, Red Bull's engineers will need to work diligently to enhance the RB21's performance and close the gap to rivals like McLaren.

Liam Lawson's future with Red Bull Racing is under scrutiny as the team prepares to assess his performance between the Japanese and Saudi Arabian Grands Prix. This evaluation could determine whether the young New Zealander continues with the team. The pressure is mounting as comparisons with Sergio ‘Checo’ Pérez and other drivers intensify.

Helmut Marko, Red Bull's consultant, has announced that Lawson's performance will be evaluated over the next few races, specifically in Japan, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. These tracks are more familiar to Lawson, potentially offering a clearer view of his capabilities.

Lawson's debut with Red Bull has been challenging. In Australia, he was eliminated in the first qualifying round and ended up in the barriers during the race due to wet conditions. This start has raised questions about his readiness to replace Pérez.

Marko has stated, “He wanted to show what he could do, but things went wrong. Now we must let him relax and evaluate his performance in the first five races.”

Lawson's performance is under the microscope as he becomes the first Red Bull driver not to finish his debut race. Meanwhile, Yuki Tsunoda's strong performances add to the pressure. If Lawson's results don't improve soon, Red Bull might reconsider their driver lineup.

Christian Horner has defended Lawson, citing his lack of experience in Melbourne as a factor in his poor result. This approach contrasts with the pressure Pérez faced to match Max Verstappen's level.

As each race unfolds, Lawson's margin for error diminishes. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether he can secure his place in the team. The world of Formula 1 is unforgiving, and Lawson's ability to adapt and improve will be vital.

McLaren's leadership, Zak Brown and Andrea Stella, have recently taken some subtle jabs at Red Bull Racing regarding staff retention. Brown, known for his candid remarks, has been a persistent critic of Red Bull. During past controversies involving Christian Horner, Brown was notably vocal. 

Following Adrian Newey's departure, Brown commented in Miami last May, "The stuff going on there is pretty destabilising. I’m guessing it won’t be the last [departure] given the resumes that are flying around."

2024 saw more key figures leaving Red Bull. Sporting Director Jonathan Wheatley moved to Sauber/Audi, and McLaren announced it had recruited Red Bull’s Head of Race Strategy, Will Courtenay, as their Sporting Director. Courtenay's arrival in Woking is delayed, with Red Bull holding him to his contract.

During the Australian Grand Prix, Stella addressed this delay, attributing it to contractual obligations and emphasizing McLaren's focus on creating an attractive work environment. Stella noted, "We are very interested in injecting expertise and understand even more about how other teams operate."

Zak Brown echoed this sentiment, emphasizing McLaren's commitment to retaining talent by fostering a desirable workplace. He stated, "People don’t steal your sponsors, drivers, or employees. You lose them. We’ve worked hard to create an environment where people want to be at McLaren."

Brown also commented on Red Bull's driver choices, suggesting Yuki Tsunoda might be a better fit for their team after his strong performance in Australia, compared to Liam Lawson's early exit.

The reintroduction of V10 engines in Formula 1 is gaining traction, with Red Bull and Ferrari backing the FIA's potential move to bring them back for the 2030 season. This shift would involve using renewable fuel, replacing the current V6 hybrid engines. The discussion has sparked mixed reactions across the paddock, with some teams concerned about the complexity and cost of the new engine rules set to kick in soon.

According to reports from Auto, Motor und Sport, a group is already assessing the feasibility of this switch, with half of the teams reportedly in support. Red Bull and Ferrari are among those pushing for change, potentially due to pressures they face with the upcoming 2026 engine regulations.

However, not all manufacturers are on board. Audi and Honda, for instance, have reservations. Audi entered F1 with hybrid technology in mind, while Honda's commitment hinges on the electrical components. A move away from hybrids could prompt Honda to reconsider its future in the sport.

Cadillac, planning to develop engines for 2026, would welcome the return of V10s. As a new OEM, they could gain an advantage by starting their power unit development earlier.

This evolving situation highlights the ongoing debate over the future direction of F1's power units, balancing tradition with innovation.
