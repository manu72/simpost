Title: Why Bright Sparks are Making the Switch to EVs

The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) in Australia is gaining momentum, much like the shift from silent films to "talkies" in the 1920s. Just as Al Jolson's voice revolutionized cinema, EVs are transforming the automotive landscape, bringing a quiet yet impactful change to our roads.

Despite some media reports suggesting a decline, the reality is far more promising. In 2024, EV sales in Australia grew by 4.7%, while petrol and diesel vehicles saw declines. A record 91,292 battery electric vehicles (BEVs) were sold, increasing to around 114,000 with plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) included. 

Tesla remains the most popular EV brand, selling 38,347 cars despite increased competition from new entrants like China's BYD and established brands like Audi and BMW, which saw significant growth in their EV sales.

Charging infrastructure is expanding rapidly, with over 1,100 fast-charging stations across the country. Western Australia has introduced an "electric highway," and New South Wales is promoting EV-friendly road trips, making long-distance travel more accessible.

Government initiatives and incentives are playing a key role in this shift. The reinstatement of subsidies and the introduction of a National Vehicle Efficiency Standard aim to cut emissions by over 60% by 2030, driving further EV adoption.

With new models from Tesla, Volkswagen, and emerging brands, the future of EVs in Australia looks bright. As Julie Delvecchio, CEO of the Electric Vehicle Council, says, "We’re very excited about 2025."

Title: Charging Towards an Electric Future

Australia is on the brink of an electrifying transformation in transportation, driven by innovative solutions and forward-thinking companies. One such leader in this space is Zenobē, a global electrification specialist, focusing on off-site charging to address the challenges in electric vehicle infrastructure.

While Australia’s electric infrastructure is still developing, factors like cost and range anxiety have slowed the transition to electric vehicles, especially in sectors reliant on long-haul trucking. However, Zenobē is paving the way for change, making electric trucking viable for businesses across the nation.

Recently, Zenobē received an $8.5 million grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to establish an ‘electric charging hub’ in Mascot, Sydney. This hub, initially serving Woolworths, will feature 22 dual-port DC fast chargers with smart charging software and repurposed battery storage from old electric vehicles. This innovative facility will support a fleet of 60 electric trucks and is designed to accommodate additional users, creating a multi-user charging environment.

Zenobē’s expertise in battery technology is well-established, being the largest owner and operator of battery storage in the UK and supporting over 2,000 battery electric vehicles globally. In Australia and New Zealand, they are advancing electric infrastructure for heavy commercial vehicles, having completed five electric bus depots since 2020.

PowerTorque spoke with Zenobē’s Australia/New Zealand Director, Gareth Ridge, about the project and its implications for the future of electric infrastructure in the country. Ridge highlighted the importance of overcoming barriers such as grid capacity and infrastructure space, and the role of funding support in facilitating these advancements.

The charging hub is currently under development approval with the City of Sydney, with an expected operational launch by June 2025. This project represents a significant step forward in Australia’s journey towards a sustainable, electric future.
