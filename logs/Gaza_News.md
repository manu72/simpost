In recent developments, tensions in the Middle East have escalated as Yemen's Houthi group claimed responsibility for a missile fired towards Israel, which was intercepted near Ben Gurion Airport, Tel Aviv. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that the missile was stopped before entering Israeli territory, with no reported injuries. The Houthis stated their actions support Palestinians in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

Meanwhile, Gaza continues to face severe air strikes from Israel. Reports indicate that Israeli strikes on Thursday resulted in the deaths of at least 10 people, with more than 430 people killed over the past two days, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The strikes reportedly targeted homes in Khan Younis, causing numerous injuries.

The situation has further intensified as the Houthis, backed by Iran, vow retaliation following recent US military actions against them. This comes amid warnings from US President Donald Trump to Iran regarding attacks on international shipping lanes.

The conflict has seen significant casualties and destruction since the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people and resulted in the capture of 251 hostages. In response, Israel's military offensive has reportedly killed over 48,500 Palestinians, highlighting the dire humanitarian crisis in the region.

As the situation unfolds, the international community watches closely, hoping for a resolution to the violence that has devastated countless lives and homes.
