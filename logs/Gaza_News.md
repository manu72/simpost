In recent developments, tensions in the Middle East have escalated as Yemen's Houthi group claimed responsibility for a missile fired towards Israel, which was intercepted near Ben Gurion Airport, Tel Aviv. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that the missile was stopped before entering Israeli territory, with no reported injuries. The Houthis stated their actions support Palestinians in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

Meanwhile, Gaza continues to face severe air strikes from Israel. Reports indicate that Israeli strikes on Thursday resulted in the deaths of at least 10 people, with more than 430 people killed over the past two days, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The strikes reportedly targeted homes in Khan Younis, causing numerous injuries.

The situation has further intensified as the Houthis, backed by Iran, vow retaliation following recent US military actions against them. This comes amid warnings from US President Donald Trump to Iran regarding attacks on international shipping lanes.

The conflict has seen significant casualties and destruction since the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people and resulted in the capture of 251 hostages. In response, Israel's military offensive has reportedly killed over 48,500 Palestinians, highlighting the dire humanitarian crisis in the region.

As the situation unfolds, the international community watches closely, hoping for a resolution to the violence that has devastated countless lives and homes.

In late February 2025, Mousa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas leader, admitted he wouldn't have supported the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel if he had foreseen the devastating response. This candid admission gains significance as Israel resumes its intense bombing campaign, ending a fragile ceasefire and resulting in hundreds of Palestinian casualties.

The situation highlights the stark power imbalance between Hamas and Israel. Despite the ceasefire deal brokered with international support, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu showed little interest in fully implementing it. The agreement involved releasing hostages and prisoners and resuming aid to Gaza, but skepticism about Netanyahu's commitment was widespread.

Hamas, holding onto its leverage with remaining hostages, aimed to maintain power and secure the release of Palestinian prisoners. However, the group misjudged the time they had to negotiate and the political dynamics within Israel. They underestimated Netanyahu's willingness to resume fighting, despite Israeli public opinion favoring an end to the war.

Hamas also misread internal Israeli politics, assuming fractures within the security establishment would prevent a return to conflict. Instead, Netanyahu's actions have consolidated his position, removing dissenting voices.

Now, as war resumes, Netanyahu's motivations include appeasing his coalition and avoiding criminal charges. Meanwhile, Hamas faces internal divisions and struggles to present a coherent strategy for Gaza's future, leaving the region in continued turmoil.

Title: US Says 'Bridge Proposal' on Table for Gaza Ceasefire but Window 'Closing Fast'

Amid escalating tensions and violence in Gaza, the US State Department announced a potential "bridge proposal" aimed at extending the ceasefire. However, officials warn that this opportunity is "closing fast."

The proposal includes the release of five hostages, among them American Edan Alexander, alongside a significant number of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Despite these efforts, the situation remains dire.

The Israeli military has resumed ground operations in Gaza, with recent airstrikes reportedly killing at least 48 Palestinians. This follows one of the deadliest days since the conflict's resurgence in October 2023, where over 400 Palestinians lost their lives.

The renewed violence shatters nearly two months of relative calm after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The conflict reignited on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants attacked Israel, resulting in 1,200 Israeli deaths and around 250 hostages taken.

Israel's military response has led to over 49,000 Palestinian deaths, according to local health officials, and has sparked accusations of genocide and war crimes, which Israel denies. The conflict has also displaced nearly the entire 2.3 million population of Gaza, causing a severe humanitarian crisis.

As the international community watches closely, the urgency for a peaceful resolution grows. The situation remains complex and deeply tragic, with lives hanging in the balance.

A British bomb disposal expert has been injured in an attack on a UN facility in the Gaza Strip, as confirmed by the charity he works for. The 51-year-old, whose name has not been released, was among five people injured in the explosion, which also claimed the life of a UN worker at the Deir al-Balah facility. The incident occurred on Wednesday morning, according to the Mines Advisory Group.

Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary general, emphasized the need for a full investigation into the incident. The Israeli military has denied targeting the UN compound, stating the explosion was not due to Israeli fire.

This development follows Israel's resumption of military operations in Gaza after a two-month ceasefire, resulting in over 400 reported deaths, as per Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry.

The injured Briton, an explosive ordnance disposal expert, was working with the Manchester-based charity to assess explosive hazards at a UN Office for Project Services building. He was initially treated in a Gaza hospital before being moved to Israel for further care.

Darren Cormack, the charity's chief executive, expressed shock over the attack on a humanitarian facility, highlighting that such actions violate international law. Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein stated that the incident is under investigation, with initial findings showing no link to IDF activity.

Gaza's health ministry has blamed an Israeli strike for the attack, while the UN's Haq reiterated the importance of protecting civilians during military operations. UNOPS head Jorge Moreira da Silva described the situation in Gaza as "unconscionable," suggesting the explosion was deliberate.

The conflict, which began with Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, has resulted in significant casualties and destruction. Israel's response has led to over 48,500 Palestinian deaths, according to Gaza’s health ministry.

British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, in a conversation with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, called for restraint from Israel amidst the renewed hostilities.

Title: Inside Israel's Fresh Ground Ops in Gaza After End of Ceasefire

The recent escalation in Gaza has seen a devastating series of airstrikes, resulting in the loss of hundreds of lives. These attacks are part of Israel's renewed ground operations following the collapse of the ceasefire, which has plunged the region into further crisis since the October 2023 conflict began.

Targeting key Hamas leaders and infrastructures, Israel has intensified its military campaign. Tragically, one airstrike claimed the lives of over a dozen mourners in the northern region, while another resulted in the death of 14 family members, according to Gaza's civil defense agency.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that this is "only the beginning," with negotiations for a new ceasefire set to occur "under fire." The US has expressed support for Israel's actions, having been consulted before the recent airstrikes.

The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) reported extensive strikes targeting Hamas operatives and infrastructure. Ground operations aim to expand the "security zone" and create a buffer between northern and southern Gaza. The Golani Brigade has been deployed, ready for further operations.

In a series of simultaneous airstrikes, Israel targeted senior Hamas figures, including Yasser Muhammad Harb Musa and Muhammad Al-Jamasi, among others, as part of their strategy to weaken Hamas' military and political capabilities.

Israel issued a "last warning" for the return of hostages held by Hamas, with Defence Minister Israel Katz demanding their release. Despite efforts to negotiate a second ceasefire, Israel continues its military actions, refusing to halt bombings for negotiations.

The situation remains tense, with the international community closely monitoring developments. The humanitarian impact on Gaza's civilian population is severe, and calls for a peaceful resolution are growing louder.

Title: ‘Our hopes are gone’: Gaza faces fresh devastation as ceasefire collapses

Across Gaza, ordinary Palestinians – men and women, old and young, ill and healthy – are sharing their fear, despair, and confusion following Israel’s renewed violence over the past two days. 

“Our hopes rose but now we are back to square one,” says Osama, a 40-year-old aid worker from al-Mawasi, a coastal area once designated as a “humanitarian zone.” This area, known for severe overcrowding and poor sanitation, is now witnessing massive Israeli airstrikes that shattered a two-month ceasefire on Tuesday, resulting in over 400 casualties. An additional 20 Palestinians were killed in further attacks on Wednesday, according to local health officials.

Israel’s defence minister has announced plans to intensify the offensive, warning Gaza residents to heed advice from the US president to return hostages and remove Hamas for other options to open up, including leaving for other countries.

In al-Mawasi, tented encampments that had emptied during the ceasefire are filling up again as people return, trying to rebuild their lives amidst ruins. “The worst thing is not the deprivation or the uncertainty. It is that the hopes we had with the ceasefire are gone,” says Osama.

Evacuation orders, renewed airstrikes, and tank shelling are forcing thousands back to makeshift camps. Leaflets dropped on Beit Hanoun warned residents that staying puts their lives in danger, urging immediate evacuation. Similar scenes are unfolding in Rafah, Khan Younis, and Shuja’iya, with over 160,000 people told to leave their homes.

Survival is a daily challenge in Gaza’s shattered landscape, lacking basic necessities like water, electricity, and reliable communication. The Red Cross field hospital in Rafah is overwhelmed, with senior medical officer Fred Oola describing the panic and devastation as palpable.

Israel re-imposed a tight blockade 17 days ago, causing prices of essentials to soar. Aid distributions are being cut to preserve stocks, with supplies running low despite 25,000 trucks entering during the ceasefire.

Almost everyone in Gaza has been displaced multiple times. Khatam al-Kafarna, a nurse from Beit Hanoun, describes the harsh reality and difficult conditions in the coastal al-Shati camp. “There is no aid, no food, no bread, no water, no rest, and no privacy,” she says. 

The camp is filling with newly displaced people, and aid agencies are struggling to meet the needs. “We used to live in a large, beautiful, safe house. Now, we all share the same tent and wait for death every moment,” al-Kafarna adds.

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu stated the strikes were ordered because Hamas rejected a ceasefire extension. Hamas, holding 59 hostages, accuses Israel of breaking a truce agreement. 

The ongoing conflict has taken a heavy toll, with over 49,000 mostly civilian casualties in Gaza. Umm Mujahid Abu Jrad, heavily pregnant and displaced eight times, expresses her anger: “Why did they do this when everything was going as it should? What more do they want?”

Israeli military officials claim the strikes targeted “terrorist” sites, including a Hamas military site and vessels intended for terrorist operations. 

As the situation in Gaza worsens, the international community watches with growing concern.

Title: Israel Extends Ground Operations in Gaza After Deadly Air Strikes

Israel has announced the extension of its ground operations in Gaza following a series of air strikes that, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, have resulted in over 430 fatalities within two days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported troop movements up to the Netzarim Corridor, a strategic area dividing the north and south of Gaza.

This escalation marks the end of a fragile ceasefire that had been in place since January. The situation intensified after the UN reported two fatalities, including one of its staff members, following an explosion at its Deir al-Balah compound. While the foreign ministry has pledged an investigation, it denies Israel's involvement.

The IDF has initiated what it describes as "targeted ground activities" to establish a "partial buffer" between northern and southern Gaza. Evacuation orders have been issued to areas such as Beit Hanoun, causing panic among Palestinian families who have faced repeated displacement. Many are fleeing by foot, cart, or vehicle, seeking safety from the impending military operations.

In a video address, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz issued a "last warning" for the return of hostages held by Hamas, stating that failure to meet demands would lead to "total destruction and devastation." Israel claims Hamas is holding 59 hostages, with 24 believed to be alive.

The UN is calling for a full investigation into the incident at its compound, with Secretary General António Guterres emphasizing the need for clarity. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the resumption of combat operations, asserting that any ceasefire talks would occur "under fire."

The air strikes, the heaviest since the ceasefire began, signal a significant escalation. Negotiations to extend the ceasefire have stalled, with Israel blocking essential supplies to Gaza since March to pressure Hamas. The current military actions underscore Israel's intent to push Hamas towards a new ceasefire agreement with the United States.

**How Trump Took Credit for the Gaza Ceasefire – and Then Let It Unravel**

Images of Palestinian children affected by the ongoing conflict in Gaza have resurfaced, highlighting the fragility of the ceasefire that once offered a glimmer of hope. Just months after former US President Donald Trump claimed credit for brokering peace, the truce has collapsed, and violence has resumed.

Despite Trump's promises to pursue peace, his administration has supported Israel's renewed military actions. Analysts suggest that Trump's interest was more about gaining headlines than achieving lasting peace. His controversial proposals, including plans for forced displacement in Gaza, further fueled tensions.

Early signs of the ceasefire's instability were evident. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated that the truce was temporary, with backing from both Trump and former President Joe Biden. Violations of the agreement, including daily attacks and humanitarian blockades, have exacerbated the situation.

The ceasefire was intended to progress through three phases, but Israel's reluctance to move beyond the initial stage has stalled peace efforts. Trump's administration, meanwhile, has been criticized for prioritizing short-term gains over genuine conflict resolution.

As violence escalates, the international community watches with concern. The renewed conflict has already resulted in significant civilian casualties, including children. Analysts fear an intensification of the offensive, which some describe as genocidal.

The situation remains dire, with little indication of a resolution. The international community continues to call for an end to the violence and a return to peace negotiations.

Thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets of Jerusalem, marching to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence to protest his decision to resume military action in Gaza. The demonstration, marked by banners and loud protests, highlights growing discontent with Netanyahu's leadership and handling of the conflict.

Protesters gathered on Wednesday, making their way through central Jerusalem to the Knesset and then to Netanyahu's home in Rehavia. The march disrupted major roads, drawing significant police presence. Many participants expressed frustration over what they see as government corruption and a mishandling of the Gaza situation.

The protest was initially organized in response to Netanyahu's attempt to dismiss the head of Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic intelligence agency. However, the renewed strikes on Gaza have intensified public anger, especially given the risks to Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

Critics accuse Netanyahu of yielding to right-wing coalition members who pushed for a return to conflict. Among them is Itamar Ben Gvir, a controversial figure who rejoined the government after quitting in protest against a ceasefire.

Netanyahu has defended his actions, asking critics what they would do if faced with similar threats. He insists that fighting is a necessary response to protect Israeli citizens.

Following the protest, Israel announced the deployment of ground forces back into Gaza, signaling a continuation of the conflict. The situation remains tense, with many Israelis calling for a change in leadership to address both internal and external challenges.
